The thriving global music consumption has led to concerns regarding detecting
violations of music copyright and difficulty for users in finding and retrieving
specific music. As a result, exploring ways to effectively retrieve information
regarding a piece of music based on its audio features rather than relying on
metadata or textual information has become a significant research concern.
Acoustic fingerprinting is an approach of interest in performing such information
retrieval, which involves identifying an audio signal by examining its unique
acoustic characteristics.
