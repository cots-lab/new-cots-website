#### Abstract
```
The early detection of potential failures in industrial machinery components is paramount for ensuring the
reliability and safety of operations, thereby preserving Machine Condition Monitoring (MCM). This research
addresses this imperative by introducing an innovative approach to Real-Time Acoustic Anomaly Detection.

Our method combines semi-supervised temporal convolution with representation learning and a hybrid
model strategy with Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) to handle various intricate anomaly patterns
found in acoustic data effectively. The proposed model demonstrates superior performance compared to
established research in the field, underscoring the effectiveness of this approach. Not only do we present
quantitative evidence of its superiority, but we also employ visual representations, such as t-SNE plots, to
further substantiate the modelâ€™s efficacy.
